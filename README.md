# odin-recipes

This is the first project from The Odin Project. I know HTML already so this was more for me to practise using Git and it has been fun! I finally know how to use it, after months of fiddling with it on VS Code and IntelliJ!

Also, learnt how to publish a Github page and am practising my Linux commands along the way. (:
